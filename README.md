# AWS QuickSight Netflix Data Visualization Project
This is my **second beginner cloud project** where I used **Amazon QuickSight** to visualize a dataset of Netflix shows. The project involved connecting data stored in **Amazon S3**, setting up a QuickSight dashboard, and using visual tools to analyze patterns in the data.
## 🔧 Tools & Services Used
- **Amazon S3** – to upload and host the dataset (`netflix.csv`) and `manifest.json` file
- **Amazon QuickSight** – to create interactive data visualizations and dashboards
## 📂 What I Did
- Created an S3 bucket and uploaded the dataset and `manifest.json` file
- Connected the S3 bucket to Amazon QuickSight via the dataset panel
- Learned how `manifest.json` helps define how QuickSight should interpret the CSV
- Built visualizations like **donut charts**, **bar graphs**, and applied **filters**
- Customized a final dashboard layout and exported it as a PDF
## 📊 Visualizations Created
- **Donut chart** showing Netflix releases by year (total ~8,810 releases)
- **Filtered bar chart** comparing Action, Adventure, Thriller, and TV Comedy releases since 2015
- Custom dashboard with clearly labeled visuals and layout arrangement
## 🧠 What I Learned
- How to structure and reference files using `manifest.json`
- How to connect datasets from S3 to QuickSight
- The power of filters and visual choices in making data meaningful
- Dashboard design and export features in QuickSight
## ⏱️ Project Duration
Approx. **2 hours**  
The most challenging part was analyzing and answering data questions using the filters but it was also the most rewarding
## 📸 Screenshots
All screenshots of the process, charts, and dashboard are included in this repository.

## 🔮 What’s Next
I’m excited to continue this AWS beginners challenge by exploring new services and building my cloud + data analysis skills.
